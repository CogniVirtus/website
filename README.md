        <sup><sub>Derived from the Latin word "cognitio," which means "knowledge" or "cognition." It's related to the act of knowing, understanding, and perceiving. In the context of AI, it suggests an emphasis on cognitive abilities, such as learning, understanding, and intelligent processing.</sub></sup>

        <b>Virtus</b>
        <sup><sub>A Latin word that carries meanings of virtue, excellence, courage, and worth. In historical contexts, "virtus" was a quality combining valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, admired as a virtue in classical Roman culture.</sub></sup>

        Our first product, the <a href="./Products/architectureCopilot.html">Architecture Copilot</a> GPT is currently in early release / soft preview as we're still tuning it.<br>
        If you'd like to take part, just [Fill out this Preview Application form](./Products/architectureCopilotPreview.md) and we'll get back to you.
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        This is only the beginning though - the Vision for Architecture Copilot is a to be like <a href="https://www.cognition-labs.com/blog">Devin</a> from Cognition Labs, except that the accent will be on co-creation rather than replacement of people as it will be a while before Architects can be replaced by pure AI.
