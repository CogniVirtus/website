# CogniVirtus
## Cogni
Derived from the Latin word "cognitio," which means "knowledge" or "cognition." It's related to the act of knowing, understanding, and perceiving. In the context of AI, it suggests an emphasis on cognitive abilities, such as learning, understanding, and intelligent processing.
## Virtus
A Latin word that carries meanings of virtue, excellence, courage, and worth. In historical contexts, "virtus" was a quality combining valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, admired as a virtue in classical Roman culture.

Combining these, "CogniVirtus" can mean "the virtue of knowledge" or "excellence in understanding". We have a focus on intellectual excellence, wisdom and the moral aspects of knowledge and learning for both people and AI's.

We're just starting, so this is very much a work in progress. Any feedback is welcome via our [Contact Form](contact.md).

## Consulting
Our staff have decades of experience with major Corporations and Consultancies working mostly with Digital/Web and Distributed systems. Since last year we've been working purely with AI and this is our focus. Although we're working on our own AI products (stay tuned...), we are open to [Strategic Consulting](Consulting/strategic.md) and Technical Consulting for the adoption and usage of AI's in a responsible and predictable manner. [Contact Us](contact.md) if you'd like more information or have a project or initiative that you'd like help with.
