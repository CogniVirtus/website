# CogniVirtus
## Cogni
Derived from the Latin word "cognitio," which means "knowledge" or "cognition." It's related to the act of knowing, understanding, and perceiving. In the context of AI, it suggests an emphasis on cognitive abilities, such as learning, understanding, and intelligent processing.
## Virtus
A Latin word that carries meanings of virtue, excellence, courage, and worth. In historical contexts, "virtus" was a quality combining valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, admired as a virtue in classical Roman culture.

Combining these, "CogniVirtus" can mean "the virtue of knowledge" or "excellence in understanding". We have a focus on intellectual excellence, wisdom and the moral aspects of knowledge and learning for both people and AI's.

We're just starting, so that's all there is for now, more soon...
